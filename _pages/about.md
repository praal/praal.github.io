I am a PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://web.cs.toronto.edu) at the University of Toronto, where I am fortunate to be working under the supervision of [Sheila McIlraith](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sheila/). Iâ€™m also affiliated with the [Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence](https://vectorinstitute.ai) and the [Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society](https://srinstitute.utoronto.ca).
Before joining UofT, I received my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from Sharif University of Technology.

My research explores topics related to AI alignment, AI safety, responsible AI, reinforcement learning, and deep learning. I am interested in building AI agents with actions properly aligned with human values. In other words, I aim to develop techniques that will allow us to characterize, understand, and build AI technologies that realize principles of safety, fairness, privacy, and where necessary and possible, interpretability.
